<h1>Hello, we are the COSMIC.GUARD team</h1>
<p>What type of orrery will you develop to depict these celestial bodies in an interactive and visually appealing manner?</p> 
<p>Will you create a video game that enables users to explore the solar system, survey asteroids for mining missions, or push PHAs to a safer orbit? Will your team generate a static orrery, or develop a dynamic orrery?</p>
<p>We are looking for answers to these questions.</p>
