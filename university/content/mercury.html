    <h1 class="texth1">Mercury: The Innermost and Smallest Planet in the Solar System</h1>

    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Diameter:</span> 4,880 km (about three times smaller than Earth).</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Distance from the Sun:</span> On average, 57.9 million km.</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Temperature Range:</span> Daytime +430°C, nighttime -180°C (extreme temperature fluctuations due to lack of atmosphere).</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Orbital Period:</span> 88 Earth days (the time it takes to orbit the Sun).</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Rotation Period:</span> 59 Earth days (the time it takes to complete one rotation on its axis).</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Atmosphere:</span> Extremely thin, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen.</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Surface:</span> Heavily cratered, similar to the Moon; no active volcanism or tectonic plate movement.</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Magnetosphere:</span> Weak magnetic field generated by liquid iron in its core.</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Type:</span> Terrestrial planet.</p>
    <p class="textp"><span class="fact">Number of Moons:</span> None.</p>

    <h2 class="texth2">Historical and Cultural Background</h2>
    <p class="textp">Mercury was named after the Roman god Mercurius, the god of travelers and merchants, and the messenger of the gods. Because Mercury is the fastest-moving planet in the Solar System—completing its orbit around the Sun in only 88 days—the Romans associated this speed with the swift nature of Mercurius.</p>
    
    <p class="textp">The discovery of Mercury is not attributed to any single person, as it was known in ancient times. It is visible from Earth to the naked eye, and it was observed by civilizations such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks thousands of years ago.</p>
    
    <h2 class="texth2">Scientific Exploration</h2>
    <p class="textp">The first more detailed scientific observations were made by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century, who observed Mercury’s phases through his telescope. The first close-up images were captured by NASA's Mariner 10 mission in 1974–75.</p>
    
    <p class="textp">Currently, the joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), known as BepiColombo, is en route to Mercury. The mission will provide detailed measurements that will further expand our understanding of the planet’s surface, magnetic field, and internal structure.</p>
